 ---   -LSB- 24 -RSB- Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC , and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest .

 ---   -LSB- 43 -RSB- In reality , Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it ; they merely wanted to gauge MITS 's interest .
 ---   MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo , and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer , and then the BASIC interpreter .
 ---   The demonstration , held at MITS 's offices in Albuquerque , was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC .
 ---   Paul Allen was hired into MITS , -LSB- 44 -RSB- and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975 .

 ---   -LSB- 44 -RSB- Within a year , the hyphen was dropped , and on November 26 , 1976 , the trade name `` Microsoft '' was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico .
 ---   -LSB- 44 -RSB- Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies .
 ---   Microsoft 's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists , but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed .
 ---   In February 1976 , Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90 percent of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair `` hobby market '' was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce , distribute , and maintain high-quality software .
 ---   -LSB- 45 -RSB- This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists , but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment .
 ---   Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976 , and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems .
 ---   -LSB- 44 -RSB- The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in Bellevue , Washington , on January 1 , 1979 .
 ---   -LSB- 43 -RSB- During Microsoft 's early years , all employees had broad responsibility for the company 's business .
 ---   Gates oversaw the business details , but continued to write code as well .

 ---   IBM partnership IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating system for its upcoming personal computer , the IBM PC .
 ---   -LSB- 47 -RSB- Big Blue first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter .
 ---   When IBM 's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system , Gates referred them to Digital Research -LRB- DRI -RRB- , makers of the widely used CP/M operating system .
 ---   -LSB- 48 -RSB- IBM 's discussions with Digital Research went poorly , and they did not reach a licensing agreement .
 ---   IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system .
 ---   A few weeks later , Gates proposed using 86-DOS -LRB- QDOS -RRB- , an operating system similar to CP/M that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products -LRB- SCP -RRB- had made for hardware similar to the PC .
 ---   Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent , and later the full owner , of 86-DOS .
